<h4> <a href="https://github.com/mariNsnv/SkyEng_testing/blob/main/pics/skyeng_project_shot.png">View project details</a> </h4>

<strong><p> Background: </p></strong>
<ul>
<li> Product: Skyeng â€“ web application for teachers </li>
<li>	Purpose: to provide teachers with the ability to connect with students, to set up schedule and track their tasks and results</li>
</ul>

<strong><p> Goal: </p></strong>
<ul>
<li>To conduct testing of web app features in order to ensure the ability of teachers to use Personal events for private meetings. Personal events should remind teachers about scheduled session.</li>
</ul>

<strong><p> Project tasks:</p></strong>
<ol>
<li> Test planning </li>
<li> Test cases/scripts development </li>
<li> Test execution </li>
<li> Test result analysis and reporting </li>
</ol>

<h4>  Step 1: Smoke, Functional, Acceptance testing of "Personal events" feature and following Regression testing.</h4>
<strong><p> Milestones:</p></strong>
<ul>
<li>Requirements analysis; </li> 
<li> Creating product mind-map; </li> 
<li>Test documentation development for Smoke, Functional and Acceptance testing; </li>
<li> Test Runs based on developed documentation, Feature release (accept-reject) decision; </li> 
<li> Regression testing of related functionality. </li>
 </ul>
 
<strong><p> Challenges & Achievements:</p></strong>
Test documentation development and test execution under heavy time pressures with incomplete requirements for the new functionality and conflicting requirements from the main stakeholders (solution: requirements refinement basing on typical / standard user scenarios). 
Regression testing with unavailable requirements/documentation on existing related functionality (solution: flexibility through exploratory and ad hoc testing).

<h4> Step 2: API testing of "Personal events" functionality </h4>
<strong><p> Milestones:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li> Creating Postman collection for API testing & Test Run for this collection; </li>
<li> Test Planning update & Test reporting update based on completed API testing. </li>
</ul>
  <strong><p> Challenges & Achievements: </strong></p>
The existing test documentation base (check lists) was not adapted for further API testing (solution: optimizing the number of cases using pairwise testing and other relevant design techniques).  
Testing process without available comprehensive technical API documentation (solution: getting information through UI using DevTools).
